Turing Machine Project or short "tm"
====================================

tm is a shared library for Linux, which is capable to "represent"
Turing Machines.

There are a few differences between the theoretical construct and
the implementation I wrote.

In this implementation there are no "alphabets" (no input alphabet and no tape
alphabet) and you can create multiple tapes.

There is only *one* accepting state and *one* rejecting state.

Furthermore you can define transitions more comfortably:
	- read *anything* from one or more tapes
	- write *nothing* to one or more tapes
	- move in any direction on one or more tapes

The following combinations are possible (for 1 tape):

r = value which is read
w = value which is written
d = direction we move to - LEFT, RIGHT or STAT

	(r0  , w0  , d0  ), //read r0, write w0, move in d0 
	(NULL, w1  , d1  ), //read anything, write w1, move in d1
	(NULL, NULL, d2  ), //read anything, write nothing, move in d2
	(NULL, w3  , NULL), //read anything, write w3, do not move
	(NULL, NULL, NULL), //read anything, write nothing, do not move
	(r5  , NULL, d5  ), //read r5, write nothing, move in d5
	(r6, , NULL, NULL), //read r6, write nothing, do not move
	(r7  , w7  , NULL), //read r7, write w7, do not move

	2 * 2 * 2 == 8
